Description: The doolkit package provides functions to explore the topography 
    of 3d triangle meshes. It was developed with dental surfaces in mind, but 
    could be applied to any triangle mesh of class 'mesh3d'.
    The package aims to group all the methods associated to dental topography
    within the same toolkit. New methods could be included and shall be 
    introduced in later versions of the package.
