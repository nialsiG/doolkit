\usage{
orient(mesh)
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{object of class mesh3d}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of occlusal orientation values in degrees for all
the polygons of the mesh.
Let the orientation from above be depicted as a trigonomical circle,
then for a tooth positioned as in Guy et al. (2015) an orientation of 0 (mesial) would
be located at an angle of pi/2, and an orientation of 90Â° (buccal) would
be located at an angle of 2*pi.
